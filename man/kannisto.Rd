\usage{
kannisto(
  rates,
  ages,
  old_ages,
  fitted_ages,
  type = "force",
  closure_age = 130,
  years = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rates}{vector, matrix or 3D array of mortality rates with age (on the rows) and
calendar year or cohort (on the columns) and simulation number (3rd dimension)}

\item{ages}{vector of ages for `rates`}

\item{old_ages}{vector of old ages for which `rates` is to be completed for}

\item{fitted_ages}{vector of ages for which model is fitted on}

\item{type}{character string representing the type of mortality rate for input and output.
Takes the following values: "central" for central death rates,
"prob" for 1-year death probabilities, "force" for force of mortality}

\item{closure_age}{maximum life span}

\item{years}{optional vector of years for `rates`. If not supplied, then the column names
of `rates` will be preserved}
}
\value{
completed mortality rates for all ages and old ages in the same format as
`rates`
}
\description{
Implements the Kannisto method of age completion for old ages.
