\title{Plot Survival Function Simulations}
\usage{
plot_surv_sim(surv_sim, init_age, target_year, level = 95, years = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{surv_sim}{3D array of forecasted survival functions with survival time
(on the rows) and calendar year or cohort (on the columns) and simulation
number (3rd dimension)}

\item{init_age}{initial age for which `surv_sim` was calculated at}

\item{target_year}{year for which the survival function is plotted for}

\item{level}{desired confidence level with 95\% as default}

\item{years}{optional vector of years for `surv_sim`. If not supplied, then the column names
of `surv_sim` will be preserved}
}

Plots simulated survival functions for a desired cohort.
