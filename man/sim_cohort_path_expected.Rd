\arguments{
\item{init_age}{the initial age of individuals}

\item{sex}{character string denoting the gender of individuals, "F" for female and "M" for male}

\item{death_probs}{a vector of 1-year death probabilities. If not supplied, an M7 age-period-cohort
model will be fitted on \code{mortality_AUS_data} to produce forecasted
death probabilities for a cohort starting at init_age in 2022}

\item{cohort}{initial cohort size}
}
\value{
vector of expected number of individuals still alive from a given cohort at each age
