#' Combine Historical and Simulated Rates
#'
#' Combines a matrix of historical and 3D array of simulated rates.
#'
#' Connects the cohort/years of historical and simulated years together.
#' See \code{\link{plot_exp_cfl}} for usage
#'
#' @param rates_hist
#' Matrix of historical mortality rates with age (on the rows) and
#' calendar year or cohort (on the columns)
#' @param rates_sim
#' 3D array of simulated mortality rates with age (on the rows) and
#' calendar year or cohort (on the columns) and simulation number (3rd dimension)
#'
#' @return
#' 3D array of combined historical and simulated rates
